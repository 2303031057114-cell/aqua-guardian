# 🌊 Aqua Guardian

Aqua Guardian is a project focused on monitoring and protecting water resources using Machine Learning and AI.  
It helps in detecting, classifying, and analyzing water pollution through datasets and models like **CNN** and **Random Forest**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects pollution in water bodies using image datasets.
- Predicts and classifies water quality using ML algorithms.
- Supports both **CNN (deep learning)** and **Random Forest (ML)** models.
- Can be integrated with real-time monitoring systems.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN model)  
- Scikit-learn (for Random Forest)  
- Pandas, NumPy (data processing)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

---

## 📂 Dataset
- NASA Marine Debris dataset from Kaggle.  
- Future integration with **Indian river datasets (Gujarat focus)**.

---

## 📊 Models Implemented
1. **CNN Model** → for image-based water pollution detection.  
2. **Random Forest Model** → for structured data pollution classification.  

---

## 📸 Sample Workflow
1. Collect water quality data / images.  
2. Preprocess the dataset.  
3. Train CNN & Random Forest models.  
4. Evaluate accuracy and performance.  
5. Deploy for real-time predictions.

---

## 🎯 Future Scope
- Real-time water quality monitoring using IoT sensors.  
- Integration with government databases for environmental tracking.  
- Mobile app interface for public awareness.
